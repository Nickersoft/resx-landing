question: "How do I avoid cancellation fees?"
order: 4

Instead of canceling directly with the restaurant (which often incurs fees), share your reservation on ResX! When another user claims your reservation, you avoid the cancellation fee entirely. 

**Here's how it works:**

1. **Submit your reservation** on ResX before the restaurant's cancellation deadline
2. **Set your asking price** (usually less than the cancellation fee)
3. **Get matched** with someone who wants your table
4. **Avoid the fee** and help someone else get a great table!

It's that simple - turn your canceled plans into someone else's perfect night out.
