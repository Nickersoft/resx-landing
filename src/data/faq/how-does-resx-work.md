question: "How does ResX work?"

ResX is a peer-to-peer reservation exchange. Every reservation on the app is posted by someone who can't make it and wants to pass it on.

When you claim one, you'll get the full details - whose name it's under, confirmation info, and the option to message the poster if needed.

We don't partner with restaurants or hold reservations ourselves - just diners helping diners.
