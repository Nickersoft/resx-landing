If you can't make a reservation you claimed, return it to the ResX feed right away. Just go to My Reservations > Claimed > click into the reservation and tap "Can't make this reservation anymore?"

If you hold the reservation for more than 5 minutes and no one else claims it, you'll be responsible for any listed cancellation fees. To avoid this, we recommend returning it immediately so someone else has the chance to grab it.
