We will alert you of material changes by placing a notice on the ResX website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you've opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven't provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

### Data that is Not Personal Data

We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the Personal Data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user. We may use such aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data and disclose it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze, build and improve the Services and promote our business, provided that we will not disclose such data in a manner that could identify you.

## Tracking Tools, Advertising, and Opt-Out

The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs and JavaScript (collectively, "Cookies") to enable our servers to recognize your web browser, tell us how and when you visit and use our Services, analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone or similar device when you use that device to access our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s).

Please note that because of our use of Cookies, the Services do not support "Do Not Track" requests sent from a browser at this time.

We may use the following types of Cookies:

- <u>Essential Cookies.</u> Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.

You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through your internet browser's settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our website and some of the Services and functionalities may not work.

## Data Security

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

### Data Retention

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

For example:

- We retain your profile information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
- We retain your payment data for as long as we need to process your purchase or subscription.
- We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively and efficiently.

If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at [support@resx.co](mailto:support@resx.co).

## U.S. State Law Privacy Rights

Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com).

### EU and UK Residents

If you are a resident of the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom ("UK"), Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU or UK General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.

For this section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and "processing" generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. ResX will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.

If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at [support@resx.co](mailto:support@resx.co). Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.

- <u>Contractual Necessity:</u> We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of "contractual necessity", meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.

- Marketing the Services.
- Corresponding with you.
- Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.
- Completing corporate transactions.

- <u>Consent:</u> In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data. When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection.

### Disclosing Personal Data

The "How We Disclose Your Personal Data" section above details how we disclose your Personal Data with third parties.

### EU, UK and Swiss Data Subject Rights

You have certain rights with respect to your Personal Data, including those set forth below. For more information about these rights, or to submit a request, please email us at [support@resx.co](mailto:support@resx.co). Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.

- **Access:** You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access certain of your Personal Data in your account.

- **Rectification:** If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can also correct some of this information directly in your account.

- **Erasure:** You can request, in some circumstances, that we erase some or all of your Personal Data from our systems without undue delay if the continued processing of that personal information is not justified.

- **Withdrawal of Consent:** If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent (as indicated at the time of collection of such data), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note, however, that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.

- **Portability:** You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format that supports re-use. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller where technically feasible.

- **Objection:** You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes. For example, you can object to our direct marketing activities for any reason by clicking the 'unsubscribe' link set out in any emails you receive, replying STOP to any text messages you receive, or toggling your preferences in your account settings (see the next section for further details).

- **Restriction of Processing:** You can ask us, in certain circumstances, to limit the purposes for which we process your Personal Data if the continued processing of the personal information in this way is not justified, such as where the accuracy of the personal information is contested by you.

- **Right to File Complaint:** You have the right to lodge a complaint about ResX's practices with respect to your Personal Data with the supervisory authority of your country or EU Member State. If you are in the UK, information on how to contact the Information Commissioner is available at [www.ico.org.uk](http://www.ico.org.uk). If you are located in the EU, a list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

### Marketing and advertising in the UK and EU

From time to time, we may contact you with information about the Services, including sending you marketing messages and asking for your feedback on our Services. Marketing messages we send will be by email, text and in app messaging. For some marketing messages, we may use personal information we collect about you to help us determine the most relevant marketing information to share with you.

We will only send you marketing messages if we have your consent or, if consent is not required under applicable law, you have not opted out of receiving messages from us. You can withdraw your consent or opt out of receiving further communications at a later date, by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our marketing emails, (in the case of text) texting STOP to our marketing texts or, if you are logged in to the Services, toggling your preferences within your account settings.

Unsubscribing from marketing emails will not unsubscribe you from system or legal notifications which we may need to send as part of the Services we provide. From time to time, we may need to contact you by email or via our support team.

### Transfers of Personal Data

The Services are hosted and operated in the United States ("U.S.") through ResX and its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is being provided to ResX in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you authorize ResX to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries. In some circumstances, your Personal Data may be transferred to the U.S. pursuant to a data processing agreement incorporating standard data protection clauses.
