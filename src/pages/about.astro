      <p>
        ResX was founded by regular people, for regular people, in response to a
        social scene that has increasingly catered only to those who can pay a
        premium or plan months ahead. Our goal is simple: to bring back the
        flexibility of last-minute planning, so you can experience the best your
        city has to offer.
      </p>

      <p>
        We represent peak culture in motion - a live look at what’s
        trending. Making the exclusive accessible without lowering the bar for
        quality.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because life’s best plans are often the last-minute ones - and everyone
        deserves a seat at the table.
