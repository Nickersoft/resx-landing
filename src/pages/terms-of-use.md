# Terms of Use

**Effective date: January 13, 2025**

Welcome to ResX. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services (including the Reservation Services, as defined below) and applications (the "Services"). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at support@resx.co.

ResX is a platform that helps users find available restaurant reservations ("Reservation Services"). It connects users seeking dining reservations ("Reservation Claimants") with other users who want to release their own reservations ("Reservation Holder"). When we use the word "you" in these Terms, it refers to any user, regardless of whether they are a Reservation Claimant or Reservation Holder, while if we use one of those specific terms, it only applies to that category of user.

ResX is committed to connecting users in order to facilitate the direct exchange of restaurant reservations between individuals and does not offer a platform for reselling of reservations. **RESX DOES NOT USE BOTS, WEB SCRAPING, OR OTHER SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES TO MAKE RESERVATIONS NOR DOES RESX ALLOW RESERVATION HOLDERS (AS DEFINED HEREIN) TO DO SO.** ResX regularly monitors the Services for misuse associated with bots or other automated technologies and takes steps to investigate any suspicious activity. Reservation Holders may pass through fees actually paid or payable to the restaurant associated with the reservation, **BUT RESX DOES NOT PERMIT RESERVATION HOLDERS TO RESELL, UPSELL, OR MAKE ANY PROFIT FROM RESERVATIONS.** In the event that ResX determines, in its sole discretion, that a Reservation Holder has misrepresented any Fees (as defined herein), ResX will terminate the Reservation Holder's account and remove any impacted reservations.

These Terms of Use (the "Terms") are a binding contract between you and RESX INC. ("ResX," "we" and "us"). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy. Your use of or participation in certain Services may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions ("Additional Terms"), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.

Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, our rules and restrictions for using these Services, limitations of liability and our responsibility to you, our right to restrict your access to or stop providing the Services, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. **PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.**

**ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER:** EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.

## Will these Terms ever change?

We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at resx.co, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.

If you don't agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

We will provide updates, including security updates, to the Services to ensure that they always comply with the terms of our contract with you. We might ask you to install these updates.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

## What about my privacy?

ResX takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current ResX Privacy Policy, please click here.

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 16 years of age; if you are a child under 16 years of age, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided us personal information, please contact us at support@resx.co.

## What are the basics of using ResX?

You may be required to sign up for an account, select a password and username ("ResX User ID"), and provide us with certain information or data, such as your contact information. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your ResX User ID a name that you do not have the right to use, or another person's name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.

You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you've received your parent's or guardian's permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party. You will comply with all laws that apply to you, your use of the Services, and your actions and omissions that relate to the Services (for example, Reservation Claimants and Reservation Holders must comply with all laws that relate to the Reservation Services). If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren't authorized to use the Services. We can't and won't be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.

You will not share your ResX User ID, account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your ResX User ID, account, password and any other access tools or credentials. You're responsible for any activity associated with your ResX User ID and account.

Please note that use of the Services is subject to your computer and/or device complying with our minimum standard technical specifications and compatibility requirements which are available here.

### Connecting Reservation Claimants and Reservation Holders

ResX is only responsible for connecting Reservation Claimants and Reservation Holders and can't and won't be responsible for making sure that reservations are actually provided or are up to a certain standard of quality. ResX similarly can't and won't be responsible for ensuring that information (including credentials) a user provides about themselves is accurate or up to date. We don't control the actions of any Reservation Claimant or Reservation Holder.

**Reservation Claimants and Reservation Holders are not employees, partners, representatives, agents, joint venturers, independent contractors or franchisees of ResX. You hereby acknowledge that ResX does not supervise, direct, control or monitor Reservation Claimants or Reservation Holders and expressly disclaims any responsibility and liability for the acts and omissions of Reservation Claimants or Reservation Holders.**

## What about messaging?

As part of the Services, you may receive communications through the Services, including messages that ResX sends you (for example, via email or SMS). When signing up for the Services, you will receive a welcome message and instructions on how to opt-in to receiving messages. By signing up for the Services, providing us with your wireless number, and ticking the aforementioned opt-in, you confirm that you want ResX to send you information regarding your account or transactions with us, which may include ResX using automated dialing technology to text you at the wireless number you provided, and you agree to receive communications from ResX. You agree to indemnify and hold ResX harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related to your breach of the foregoing.

In connection with the Services, we may send reminder texts ahead of your reservation. By claiming a reservation, you consent to receive text messages about your reservation 2 hours before your selected reservation time. For example, if you claim a reservation scheduled for 8:00 AM, you will receive a text message reminder at 6:00 AM.

## Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?

You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not provide or contribute anything, including any Content or User Submission (as those terms are defined below), to the Services, or otherwise use or interact with the Services, in a manner that:

- (a) infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including ResX);
- (b) violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any applicable export control laws, privacy laws or any other purpose not reasonably intended by ResX;
- (c) is dangerous, harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
- (d) jeopardizes the security of your ResX User ID, account or anyone else's (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);
- (e) attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;
- (f) violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;
- (g) runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or "spam" on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services' infrastructure);
- (h) "crawls," "scrapes," or "spiders" any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);
- (i) copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; or
- (j) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.

A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.

## Are there any terms specific to me as a Reservation Holder?

You represent and warrant that any reservation information, including but not limited to any proof of a reservation, such as screenshots and reservation links, that you submit to the Services is accurate, complete, and up-to-date, and you agree that you will not modify or cancel a reservation once a Reservation Claimant has claimed the reservation except as requested by ResX. Reservation Holders must not copy, collect, use, or disclose any information from or relating to Reservation Claimants ("Claimant Information") beyond what is necessary to provide a specific reservation to the applicable Reservation Claimant. Upon the conclusion of the Reservation Services for a Reservation Claimant (or otherwise upon the request of such Reservation Claimant or ResX), Reservation Holder must properly delete or destroy all Claimant Information from or relating to such Reservation Claimant and make no further use of it whatsoever. Reservation Holders must collect, use, maintain, and transmit all Claimant Information in compliance with all applicable laws and these Terms.

## What are my rights in the Services?

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (as defined below) and so forth (all of the foregoing, the "Content") are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won't use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else's (including ResX's) rights.

Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for any purpose other than using the Services is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You understand that ResX owns the Services. You won't modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content, but please remember that even where these functionalities exist, all the restrictions in this section still apply.

## What about anything I contribute to the Services – do I have to grant any licenses to ResX or to other users?

### User Submissions

Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your "User Submission". Some User Submissions may be viewable by other users. You are solely responsible for all User Submissions you contribute to the Services. You represent that all User Submissions submitted by you are accurate, complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.

You agree that you will not post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services any User Submissions that: (i) infringe any third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.); (ii) contain sexually explicit content or pornography; (iii) contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incite hatred against any individual or group; (iv) exploit minors; (v) depict unlawful acts or extreme violence; (vi) depict animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals; (vii) promote fraudulent schemes, multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, get rich quick schemes, online gaming and gambling, cash gifting, work from home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures; or (viii) that violate any law.

### Licenses

In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions (see below for more information). Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our [Privacy policy](/privacy-policy) to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.

By submitting User Submissions through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant ResX a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions in connection with this site, the Services and our (and our successors' and assigns') businesses, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of this site or the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites and feeds), and including after your termination of your account or the Services. You also hereby do and shall grant each user of this site and/or the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your User Submissions through this site and/or the Services, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions, including after your termination of your account or the Services. For clarity, the foregoing license grants to us and our users do not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Submissions, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Submissions, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

## What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?

In accordance with the DMCA, we've adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement. Please note that if you are in the UK or EU, please send any infringement notices to founders@resx.co. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members or users and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.

1. ### Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements

   If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Services infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to ResX's "Designated Agent" to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (whose contact details are listed below):
   1. A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;
   2. Identification of works or materials being infringed;
   3. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that ResX is capable of finding and verifying its existence;
   4. Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;
   5. A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified in (1)(c) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
   6. A statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.

2. ### Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent

   Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:
   1. remove or disable access to the infringing material;
   2. notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; and
   3. terminate such content provider's access to the Services if they are a repeat offender.

3. ### Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent

   If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider may send us a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent:
   1. A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;
   2. Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;
   3. A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
   4. Content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider's address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which ResX is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.

   If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, ResX may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that ResX may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at ResX's discretion.

   Please contact ResX's Designated Agent at the following address:

   ResX
   Attn: DMCA Designated Agent
   4 Devoe Road
   Armonk, NY 10504

## Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?

Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and you access all such information and Content at your own risk, and we aren't liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can't guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.

You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.

The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by ResX. When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that ResX is not responsible for such risks.

ResX has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, ResX will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that ResX is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release ResX, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party."

## Will ResX ever change the Services?

We're always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We'll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn't always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

## Do the Services cost anything?

The Services may be free, or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.

<div class="list-alpha">

1. ### Paid Services

   Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future, including but not limited to (i) subscription services for our premium content ("Premium Services") and (ii) fees charged by third parties in connection with the Services, such as cancellation and payment processing fees (together, the "Paid Services"). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms. You agree to comply with, and your license to use our mobile application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. Any refunds relating to the applications or inquiries regarding refunds relating to the applications shall be handled solely by the applicable App Store in accordance with such App Store's terms and conditions.

2. ### Subscription

   To purchase a subscription, you must click on the 'Join ResX Premium' button in the ResX app to place an order. Confirmation that your order has been successfully submitted does not mean that your order has been accepted by us. Your order is an offer to buy a subscription to the Premium Services on these Terms. Acceptance of your order by us takes place when we send you an order confirmation email, at which point a legally binding contract for the purchase is formed between you and us on these Terms.

3. ### Rejecting your order

   If we do not accept your order, for example because we have been unable to take payment, you are under 18, or live in a country for which we are not able to process your order, or there has been a mistake regarding the pricing or description of the Paid Services, we will email you and provide you with a refund if payment has already been taken. We have the right to reject any order for any reason.

4. ### Billing

   We use a third-party payment processor (the "Payment Processor") to charge or bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. The Payment Processor may charge additional payment processing fees which will be charged to your Billing Account. You can access Stripe's Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method"). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

5. ### Payment Method

   The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.

6. ### Recurring Billing

   Some of the Premium Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature, and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. \*\*WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, ACCESS THE SETTINGS OF THE GOOGLE PLAY OR APP STORE (AS RELEVANT) OR BY EMAILING SUPPORT@RESX.CO.**

7. ### Current Information Required

   **YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR BY EMAILING US AT SUPPORT@RESX.CO. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.**

8. ### Preauthorization

   You acknowledge and agree that we may preauthorize or place a temporary charge on your debit or credit card at the time you provide your debit or credit card information to confirm that your Payment Method works prior to charging any third-party fees related to the Services, including but not limited to Fees, as described below. If you are a Reservation Claimant, you hereby authorize us to preauthorize your debit or credit card when you provide your debit or credit card information upon selection of a reservation with Fees (as defined below). Within 5-7 business days, the temporary preauthorization charge will be removed.

9. ### Change in Amount Authorized

   If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

10. ### Reservation Fees
    1. #### Reservation Holders

       In the event a Reservation Holder submits a reservation to the Services, Reservation Holder shall be directly and solely responsible for any associated fees and/or pre-paid deposits or service fees from any third-party restaurant ("Fees") if a Reservation Claimant does not claim such the reservation. In the event a Reservation Holder's reservation is claimed, and the Reservation Claimant does not show up to the reservation or cancels or releases such reservation more than five (5) minutes after claiming it (such five (5)-minute period, the "Grace Period"), ResX shall charge the Reservation Claimant for any associated Fees. Upon payment by Reservation Claimant, ResX shall reimburse Reservation Holder for any documented Fees. For clarity, if a Reservation Claimant cancels or releases a reservation during the Grace Period, and no other Reservation Claimant claims the reservation, the Reservation Holder shall be responsible for all Fees.

    2. #### Reservation Claimants

       Reservation Claimant acknowledges and agrees that they are directly and solely responsible for any Fees for claimed reservations following the expiration of the Grace Period, except as provided for herein. If you, as the Reservation Claimant, used a premium token to claim a reservation, such premium token will not be refunded upon cancellation of the reservation.

11. ### Auto-Renewal for Premium Services

    Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through the settings on the Google Play or App Store (as relevant), or by emailing us at support@resx.co, any Premium Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. If you are on an annual subscription, you will be reminded that your subscription is coming up to renewal on or around 14 days before the renewal date. The annual reminder will also contain details of the price payable for the renewal. You will then have until 14 days after the date of your annual renewal to cancel your subscription in order to avoid being charged for the renewed subscription term. To change or resign your Premium Services at any time, you can cancel your subscription in the settings on the Google Play or App Store (as relevant). If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. **IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SERVICE THROUGH THE GOOGLE PLAY OR APP STORE (AS RELEVANT) OR BY EMAILING SUPPORT@RESX.CO OR TERMINATE YOUR RESX ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING TERM. PAID SERVICES CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, RESX WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID.**

12. ### Cooling off Period

    Except in the circumstances listed in the next sentence, you have the right to change your mind and cancel an annual subscription to the Premium Services within 14 days from the date of your order confirmation or account opening email. You can't change your mind about an order for services (such as a year's subscription to the Premium Services), once these have been completed (i.e. after that year has passed)

13. ### Reaffirmation of Authorization

Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment, and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.

14. ### Free Trials and Other Promotions

Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. If you are offered this, then the free trial period for any subscription will last for the period of time specified when you signed up ("Trial Period"). While you won't be charged for your free trial, you'll be upgraded to a paid subscription automatically at the end of the Trial Period. We will remind you that your Trial Period is about to end prior to your paid subscription starting. The reminder will also contain details of the price payable for the paid subscription. You will then have until 14 days after the date of your paid subscription starting to cancel in order to avoid being charged for the first subscription term. If you cancel prior to the end of the Trial Period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at support@resx.co.

## What if I want to stop using the Services?

If you are a Reservation Claimant and would like to cancel a reservation, you can do so at any time in the "My Reservations" tab; provided, however, that if you cancel a reservation after the expiration of the Grace Period, you are responsible for all associated Fees, as described above.

If you want to close your account with ResX, you're free to do that at any time by contacting us at support@resx.co or selecting 'Delete account' in your Account settings. ResX is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. ResX has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms; for example, a Reservation Claimant who believes that a Reservation Holder may be in breach of these Terms is not able to enforce these Terms against that Reservation Holder.

Account termination may result in the destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. We will on request provide you with a copy of your Content within 30 days of your account closure in a machine-readable format. Otherwise, we will cease to use and delete all content stored in your account and your user details (except where we are required by law to retain such details). Please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at support@resx.co – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can't promise that we can recover or restore anything.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.

## What about Mobile Applications and In-App Purchases?

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an "App Store"). Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.

Through our mobile applications, you may purchase ("In-App Purchase") certain goods or features designed to enhance the performance of the Services. When you make an In-App Purchase, you are doing so through either the Apple iTunes service or the Google Play service and you are agreeing to their respective terms and conditions, available at http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html and http://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms.html. ResX is not a party to any In-App Purchase.

## I use the ResX app available via the Apple App Store – should I know anything about that?

These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS applications (the "Application") available via the Apple, Inc. ("Apple") App Store, but the following Additional Terms also apply to the Application:

<div class="[&>ol]:list-alpha">

1. Both you and ResX acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and ResX only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;
2. The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;
3. You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;
4. You acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;
5. In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple's sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;
6. You acknowledge and agree that ResX, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;
7. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, ResX, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;
8. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;
9. Both you and ResX acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and
10. Both you and ResX acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple's subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

## What else do I need to know?

If you are located in the US, the following 'Warranty Disclaimer', 'Limitation of Liability', and 'Indemnity' sections apply:

### Warranty Disclaimer

ResX and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (ResX and all such parties together, the "ResX Parties") make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the ResX Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services. The ResX Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services, including any Reservation Services. **THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY RESX (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

### Limitation of Liability

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE RESX PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO RESX IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.**

### Indemnity

You agree to indemnify and hold the ResX Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action ("Claim"), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

**_If you are located in the UK, the following 'Warranty Disclaimer,' 'Limitation of Liability', and 'Assignment' sections apply:_**

### Warranty Disclaimer

Although ResX have taken all reasonable care to ensure that the features and functionalities provided are of a reasonably satisfactory standard, certain features may rely on networks and connections that are beyond our control. The ResX Parties shall therefore not be liable, or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations to you which is caused by events outside our reasonable control. We do not guarantee that the Services will be compatible with all or any hardware and software which you may use. We do not guarantee that the Services will be available at all times or at any specific time.

### Limitation of Liability

We will never be responsible for any loss or damage, that is:

- not reasonably foreseeable (this means that it was not obvious that it would happen and nothing you said to us before using the Services meant we should have expected it);
- caused by a failure by you to comply with these Terms;
- a business loss;
- caused by a failure by you to install any update provided with sufficient installation instructions within a reasonable time (provided we have explained the consequences of failing to install the update); or
- something you could have avoided by taking reasonable action.

Our responsibility to you will be limited to the greater of (i) the amount paid, if any, by you to ResX for the Services during the 12 months prior to any claim, or (ii) £100. We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors or for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

### Assignment

You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without ResX's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

**_If you are located in the US, the following 'Choice of Law' and 'Arbitration Agreement' sections apply:_**

### Choice of Law (US)

These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

### Arbitration Agreement (US)

Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with ResX and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from ResX. Both you and ResX acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, ResX'S officers, directors, employees and independent contractors ("Personnel") are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

<div class="[&>ol]:list-alpha">

1. #### Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement

The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York County, New York. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "Rules") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

2. #### Costs of Arbitration

The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. ResX will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. ResX will not seek its attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

3. #### Small Claims Court; Infringement

Either you or ResX may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in New York County, New York or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

4. #### Waiver of Jury Trial

**YOU AND RESX WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY.** You and ResX are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and ResX over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, **YOU AND RESX WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL**, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

5. #### Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions

**ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.** If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor ResX is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.

6. #### Opt-out

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 4 Devoe Road, Armonk, NY 10504 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms' arbitration agreement.

7. #### Exclusive Venue

If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or ResX to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and ResX agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, New York County, New York, or the federal district in which that county falls.

8. #### Severability

If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with ResX.

</div>

**_If you are located in the UK, the following 'Choice of Law and Jurisdiction' and 'Dispute Resolution' sections apply:_**

### Choice of Law and Jurisdiction (UK)

These terms are governed by English law and wherever you live you can bring claims against us in the English courts. We can claim against you in the courts of the country you live in.

### Dispute Resolution (UK)

Any dispute arising from or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Services shall be dealt with by engaging in the first instance with each other in good faith to try and resolve such dispute before any formal legal process. If you have a complaint or wish to raise a concern, please do so by support@resx.co.

### Miscellaneous

You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the ResX may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and ResX agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and ResX, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of ResX, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind ResX in any respect whatsoever.

Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple app and the arbitration agreement, you and ResX agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
