# Adding motion

While most animations should probably be handled via Tailwind `animate-` classes when possible, for certain complex animations it is easier to rely on [Motion](https://motion.dev/), previously known as Framer Motion.

You can access [Framer Motion's React API](https://motion.dev/docs/react-animation) via the `motion/react` import. When used inside Astro `<script>` tags, you can use the [vanilla API](https://motion.dev/docs/quick-start) instead.
