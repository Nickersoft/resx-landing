# Adding new Tailwind Colors

This repository uses the latest version of Tailwind (v4 as of this writing) with the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, meaning the site's theme is controlled entirely by CSS variables, located in `theme.css` and import into the global stylesheet.

This repo also follows `shadcn-ui`'s [CSS theming and variable names](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming). These probably should not be renamed at all, in order to keep `shadcn-ui` working correctly.
