## What's Inside

### Building Blocks

- 📦 **[PNPM](https://pnpm.io)** for package management, as it's much faster and more performant than NPM. You can enable it via corepack via `corepack enable`.
- 🚀 **[Astro](https://astro.build)**, a framework for creating highly-versatile and high-performance webpages. It comes packed with a boatload of features such as partial hydration, content collections, and server endpoints. [See here](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/) for more.
- ⚛️ **[React](https://react.dev)** for creating interactive component islands that leverage React's booming ecosystem.
- 👷 **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** for writing type-safe, maintainable code.

### UI & Styling

- 🪁 **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** for modular, consistent CSS styling. Includes plugins such as [tailwindcss-typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) and [tailwindcss-animate](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate).
- 🔠 **[Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/)** for loading custom fonts. These can be preloaded via the `preload` prop of [`BaseLayout`](src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro).
- 📥 **[shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** for rapidly adding pre-configured UI components to your website.
- 🦄 **[unplugin-icons](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-icons)** for easily inlining thousands of on-demand icons in Astro and React components.
- ⚒️ Custom component primitives such as [Typography](src/components/ui/Typography.tsx) and [Stack](src/components/ui/Stack.tsx).

### Animations

- 🚥 **[Rive](https://rive.app)** for embedding performant, interactive animations on your site.
- 🏃 **[Motion](https://motion.dev)** (formerly Framer Motion) for creating realistic spring animations in JavaScript.

### Developer Experience

- 📝 **[oxlint](oxc.rs)** for lightning-fast linting in JavaScript and TypeScript (written in Rust)
- 🎨 **[Prettier](prettier.io)** for opinionated formatting (only used because Biome's HTML formatting is [incomplete](https://biomejs.dev/internals/language-support/)).
- 🐶 **[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)** with **[lint-staged](https://github.com/lint-staged/lint-staged)** to automatically run linting on new commits.
